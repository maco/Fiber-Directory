<p>Welcome to the Mid-Atlantic Fibershed. This site is inspired by Rebecca Burgess's <a href="http://fibershed.com">Fibershed</a> project, but the specific focus of this site is DC, Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, and Pennsylvania. These states are all reachable within 100 miles of Washington, DC.</p>
<p>This is a directory of farmers, artisans, and businesses in the region. Have you ever considered a garment made locally from fibers grown locally? If you want to make such a thing happen, you can find locally-grown fibers, weavers or knitters to turn it into fabric, and tailors to sew it.  At least, that's the theory. This site is new, so if you have suggestions for additions to the database, please <a href="/contact/">contact</a> us!</p>
